  First we identify the tickets that needs to be completed. This can be done by searching for the ticket number or by browsing the list of open tickets in the osTicket application. 
  
  Lets open the ticket created by John Doe.

  Once open, we can review the ticket and its details. Make sure you understand the issue described in the ticket and that you have all the necessary information to resolve it.

  Take the necessary actions to resolve the issue. If you need more information from the user, you can use write your reply in the text box, and even choose from a canned response to 
  template your message for common responses.

  Once the issue has been resolved, you can close the ticket by marking it as 'resolved' or 'closed' in the osTicket application. This will move the ticket to the closed ticket list. You may also 
  need to provide a brief summary or report on the resolution of the issue.
